# Open Trainer Project (Discontinued)
### Free and open source game trainer by pharrax
Trainers are written in C# with help of open source library memory.dll (https://github.com/erfg12/memory.dll/wiki)

## Who are you?
Hello, my name is Andreas. I'm just a guy trying to learn.

## Why do this?
I wanted to give something to the community.
Whenever I use a trainer I'm never sure what it does exactly. So I read a little into the topic and decided
to write my own trainer.

## How to use?
Just go to the releases tab in this repository and download the trainer you want.
```
It's an .exe file, just run the trainer with admin permission (should ask automatically)
```
```
Then open the game (or start the game first, doesn't matter)
```
```
The trainer should say "GAME FOUND, ID: 0xXXXX"
```
```
You're good to go, just press the hotkeys F1-FX to activate the functions.
```
