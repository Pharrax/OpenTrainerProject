### Free and open source game trainers by pharrax

## Who are you?
I'm pharrax just a IT-student trying to learn. 

## Why do this?
I wanted to give something to the community.
Whenever I use a trainer I'm never sure what it does exactly. So I read a little into the topic and decided
to write my own trainer. I'm pretty sure I'll make more based on this first one.

## How to use?
Just go to the releases tab in this repository and download the trainer you want.
```
It's an .exe file, just run the trainer with admin permission (should ask automatically)
```
```
Then open the game (or start the game first, doesn't matter)
```
```
The trainer should say "GAME FOUND, ID: 0xXXXX"
```
```
You're good to go, just press the hotkeys F1-FX to activate the functions.
```
